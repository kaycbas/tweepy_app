## Tweepy App - Crypto Social Tracker
This app attempts to measure the social engagement of various cryptocurrencies on Twitter to help inform investment decisions. 
The app is built on the premise that the price of many cryptocurrencies is strongly affected by the amount of 'hype' or 'shilling'
that occurs on social media. When there is a lot of hype around a coin, or when coins have large announcements that create ripples
of activitiy on social media, prices tend to jump as many people, esspecially 'newbies', decide to invest. The app measures the 
'velocity' (tweets/time window) of various cryptocurrencies and then outputs the results in an easily understandable graphical format.
